## üß† Tech & Pattern Choices: Reasoning

### Why these technologies?

- Next.js:
  Provides a powerful React framework with built-in routing, server-side rendering (SSR), static site generation (SSG), and API routes. It‚Äôs ideal for scalable, production-ready web apps.
- Tailwind CSS:
  Enables rapid UI development with utility-first classes, leading to a consistent design system and easy customization without writing custom CSS.
- shadcn/ui:
  Offers a set of accessible, unstyled, and headless UI components that work seamlessly with Tailwind CSS, allowing for fast prototyping and easy customization.
- Zustand:
  A minimal, scalable state management library for React. Zustand is easy to use, avoids boilerplate, and is ideal for managing global state in modern React apps.
- Zod + react-hook-form:
  Zod provides type-safe schema validation, and react-hook-form is a performant, flexible form library. Combined, they enable robust, type-safe, and user-friendly form handling with instant validation feedback.
- TypeScript:
  Ensures type safety across the codebase, reducing bugs and improving developer experience.

### Why these patterns?

- Component-based architecture:
  The app is broken into small, reusable components for maintainability, scalability, and easier testing.
- Separation of concerns:
  Logic, UI, and state management are separated into different modules (store, components, config), making the codebase easier to navigate and extend.
- Hooks for state and effects:
  React hooks are used for local and global state, side effects, and form logic, resulting in cleaner and more idiomatic React code.
- Responsive & accessible UI:
  All UI components are designed to be responsive and accessible out of the box, ensuring a good experience on all devices and for all users.
